Simulation input parameters for paper submission "Boundary layers in quasi-static magnetoconvection with a vertical field and their implications for heat transport"
https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08623

The input parameters, including the Chandrasekhar number (Q), the Rayleigh number (Ra), the timestep (dt), the horizontal resolution in 'x' (Nx), horizontal resolution in 'y' (Ny), vertical resolution in 'z' (Nz), are listed for all simulations. 

In all simulations presented, we use isothermal boundary conditions. For the bulk of this manuscript we use stress-free and electrically insulating boundary conditions. The input parameters for these simulations are listed in "simulation_inputs.csv."

For a small subset of simulations, we replace the mechanical boundary conditions such that the bounding plates are no-slip. The input parameters for this subset is listed in "simulation_inputs.csv."

For yet another subset of simulations, we replace the electricomagnetic boundary conditions to be vertical-field. The simulation parameters for this subset is listed in "simulation_inputs_verticalfield.csv."
